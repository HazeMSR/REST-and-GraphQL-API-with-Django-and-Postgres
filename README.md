## REST-or-GraphQL-API-with-Django-and-Postgres

Using your restaurant app use it to do the following:

- Create an Endpoint(s) which allow to do CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) of any element of your Restaurant. (Except delete the restaurant).
- If you are using REST architecture must allow the five main HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
- If you are using GraphQL architecture must allow query and mutate all your elements (Create a different mutation for each operation: Create, Update and Delete).
